# CoralLauncher
The old coral launcher used for Project Coral
- i have decided to make the old coral launcher open source. Feel free to expore it but pls dont use it in your project because this launcher is half CHATGPT made. I made this launcher like 9 months ago. Its pretty old...

- Remember that I MADE THIS ALMOST 1 YEAR AGO I WASNT A GOOD CODER AND YES I USED EON V1 LAUNCH CODE :) But no need to be mad at me or anything because everyone starts ogfn at 1 point 

- And 1 thing more yes u can use this in ur project if u can get it to work
